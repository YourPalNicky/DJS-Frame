# DJS-Frame
Discord.JS v12 Framework

## Configuration
1) Insert all of your custom configuration settings into `config/config.json`
2) Insert your bot token into `config/.env`

## Installation & Setup
There are two main methods to set up the bot and install all dependencies: the command line or the included installation file.

### Method  1: Included Installation File
1) Run `start.bat`, all required dependencies should install, and then the bot will automatically log in.

Note: If option 1 does not work for you, please go on to Method 2.
### Method 2: Command Line
1) Run the following commands in the command line to install the required dependencies.
```bash
npm i discord.js
npm i dotenv
npm i fs
```
2) Run `node index.js` to bring your bot online. (You will have to repeat this step or use your own method each time you would like to bring your bot online)
